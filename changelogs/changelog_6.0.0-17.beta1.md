# Search Guard 6.0.0-17.beta1

Release Date: 21.11.2017

## Search Guard SSL

* Disable client initiated TLS renegotiation by default
* Disable HTTP compression by default when https is enabled

## Search Guard Core

* Search Guard ships as [Enterprise Edition](../license_enterprise.md) by default
 * All enterprise modules are already contained in the plugin
 * You don't need to download and install them manually anymore

* [Search Guard Community Edition](../license_community.md) switch
 * Enable the Community Edition by adding a switch in elasticsearch.yml     

* Improved the [demo installer](../quickstart.md) installer for easy PoC setup
 * If configured, Search Guard initializes its index automatically if it's not present

* Usage of the Search Guard certificates generated by the demo installer [must be allowed explicitely](demo_installer_artefacts.md)
 * Production safeguard

* Full [Cross Cluster Search support](../crossclustersearch.md)

* Full support for [Custom authentication modules](../custom_auth.md)

* [Authenticators can be enabled and disabled for REST and transport individually](../configuration_auth.md)

* Custom user attributes for index names and [DLS queries](../dlsfls.md)
 * Use additional properties from authentication backends for variable substitution
 * For example, use a JWT claim value directly in an index name or DLS query

* User impersonation on REST layer  

* [Role Mapping Modes](../configuration_roles_mapping_modes.md)
 * You can now map backend roles to Search Guard roles directly 

* Made PEM certificates a first class citizen

* **BREAKING**: Alias checks on index-level
 * You can only create aliases on indices you have permissions for  

* `whoami` switch for sgadmin
 * Outputs infos regarding the used certificate, useful for debugging
License system, license checks

* Introduced [License Handling](../license_enterprise.md)

* Added endpoint for license and installed modules
 * `https://<host>:<http_port>/_searchguard/license`

* Removed fallback to default authenticator
 * If no authentication domain is configured, Search Guard will now raise an error

## REST management API

* Introduced [role-based access control](../managementapi.md)
 * You can configure which roles have access to the API in `elasticsearch.yml` 
 * If the Search Guard index is initialized, access is possible without an admin certificate
* Access control for endpoints and methods
 * You can grant roles permissions for specific endpoints and methods
 * For example, allow to view roles, but disallow to change or delete them
* Globally disable endpoints and methods

* Reserved resources
 * Any resource, like users, role or permissions, can be marked as read-only
 * read-only permissions are not changeable by the REST API
 * Use to protected resources like the Kibana server user  

## Search Guard Kibana Plugin

* Moved release location from 6.x onwards to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22search-guard-kibana-plugin%22)
 

## Kibana Configuration GUI

* Completely new [Kibana based configuration GUI](../kibana_config_gui.md)
 * Roles, Role Mappings, Action Groups and Internal Users

* Can be used in conjunction or as an alternative to `sgadmin`

* Configure index- and document-type level permissions

* Configure Document- and Field-Level-Security

* Configure Multi Tenancy

* Display configured authentication and authorization modules

* Display system status, installed modules and license information

* Auto-detection of available modules
 * No configuration in `kibana.yml` necessary  

* Based on the role-based access feature of the REST-API

## BREAKING: Audit logging

* Completely revised the [Audit Log Module](../auditlogging.md)
 * Since the structure of the events has changed, the new default index name is `auditlog6`

* Events can be tracked on REST-layer, transport-layer or both

* Events can be skipped based on their action (transport layer) and/or REST request path (REST layer)

* You can configure whether sub-requests for bulk requests should be stored separately
 * Before, sub-requests have been added to the original event as numbered fields
 * This leads to field limit problems for huge bulk requests 
 * Sub-requests can now be logged as separate events and then correlated

* Events can now be correlated by a field `task_id`

* Introduced new category GRANTED_PRIVILEGES
 * Before, both succesfull authentication events and other successfull requests have been logged in the AUTHENTICATED category
 * Succesfull authentication events are still written to the AUTHENTICATED category
 * Other successfull events are written to the GRANTED_PRIVILEGES category

* Improved back-pressure handling 

* Configurable queue sizes

* Added PEM support for external_elasticsearch and webhook storage types

* Added PEM support for external_elasticsearch and webhook storage types

* Added `log4j` storage type
 * Use `log4j` appenders as event sink, e.g. SNMP 

## Document-Level security

* Use custom user attributes for dynamic [DLS queries](../dlsfls.md)
 * This makes it possible to write powerful dynamic queries based on user attributes 
 * For example, JWT claims
 * For example, LDAP attributes

## JWT

* All claims are added as custom user attributes with the `attr.jwt.` prefix
* Can be used as variables in DLS queries and index names

## Active Directory / LDAP

* All attributes of the user entry are added as custom user attributes with the `ldap.ldap.` prefix
* Can be used as variables in DLS queries and index names

## Known Issues

* The Kibana Config GUI might log a JSON error on the console from time to time
* Multi Tenancy upgrade from Kibana 5 to Kibana 6 may break
* Warning message on install about missing sha512 checksum
